# Brain-Tumor-Detection

  
A machine-learning / deep-learning project to detect brain tumors from MRI images.  

## 🚀 Project Overview  
This project implements a pipeline for classification of MRI brain scans into categories (e.g., “tumour” vs “no tumour”) using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The goal is to support early detection of brain tumours, leveraging image-processing and deep-learning techniques.  
The work is contained in the notebook `Brain_Tumor_Detection.ipynb`, which walks through dataset loading, preprocessing, model training & evaluation, and prediction.

## 🔍 Key Features  
- Data loading & exploration of MRI images  
- Pre-processing: resizing, normalization, augmentation  
- Building a CNN model (or transfer-learning) to classify images  
- Splitting into training / validation sets  
- Model training, evaluation (accuracy, loss curves)  
- Displaying sample predictions and confusion matrix  
- Optionally saving the trained model for future use
